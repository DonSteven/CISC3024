3024original-model includes the code corresponding to the experimental stage in the report and the visualization of the result. 
3024bayes corresponds to the optimalization stage in the report. It aims to find the optimal hyperparameters through Bayes algorithm. Then, a list of parameters are obtained and preseverd in the file "3024_TPE(1) (1).pkl". We then turn to "3024original-model" to visualize our result using the optimal parameters.
